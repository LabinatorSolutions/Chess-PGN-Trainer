## TODO
- [ ] Ability to do the set in random order
- [ ] Add selector for pawn promotion (defaults currently to queen.  Will not work with puzzles requiring pawn promotion to anything other than a queen.)

## ISSUES
- [ ] Refactor to ensure that the app knows when a set is complete.
- [ ] Update error count tracking to be by PUZZLE, not each individual error (otherwise could make error rate > 100%)
