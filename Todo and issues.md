## TODO
- [ ] Record error number
- [ ] Record time for completion
- [ ] Save results to project file
- [ ] Ability to export the project file results to simple csv
- [ ] Ability to do the set in random order
- [ ] Hint button?


## ISSUES
- [ ] Add selector for pawn promotion (defaults currently to queen.  Will not work with some puzzles.)
- [ ] Refactor to ensure that the app knows when a set is complete.
- [ ] Update error count tracking to be by PUZZLE, not each individual error (otherwise could make error rate > 100%)
